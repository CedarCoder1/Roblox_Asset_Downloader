# Roblox Asset Downloader
Lets users download all of the Roblox client and studio stuff from the setup website. Also automatically puts the files in the right place. Written in Python.

The output and extra's folders contain parts of an example downloaded build.
Currently supported builds:
* Roblox Player for Windows
* Roblox Studio for Windows

Keep in mind this program also downloads files who's name start with a dot (.) and keepme, which are removed by the official Roblox installers on install.

## Todo
* Find out where AppSettings.xml comes from.
* Mac OS Support
* Make the Extra downloads feature, so all other stuff from the cdn can be downloaded easily.
* Archive.org support.
* RCCService support (only available rccservice builds might be saved on archive.org).
